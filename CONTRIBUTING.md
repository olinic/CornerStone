## Choose a Path

There are two avenues for contributing: **creating/updating adapters** and **maintaining the core**.

Additional adapters are a crucial part of CornerStone. Adapters improve the service and content available to developers by connecting developers to more Bible APIs.

On a similar note, all of the adapters rely on the core. The core is designed to ease the development of adapters and provide lots of functionality to users.

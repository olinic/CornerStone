Unit testing directory. Powered by Jasmine.

If you are using Google Chrome for testing, you can enable the following:
   chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost
to ensure that HTTPS tests pass.

ExpressServer/server.js
The express js server is used for unit testing CornerStone.
You can run the server using the following (from the project directory):
   node ./spec/ExpressServer/server.js <seconds>
To access the server, navigate to http://localhost:<port>/path/

For the server to provide HTTPS, the cert.pem (self-signed) and key.pem are
required.

SpecBundle.js
The spec bundle is generated by webpack from the SpecBrowserTests.js. The bundle
has all of the specs to be run on the browser. The bundle is included in the
SpecRunner.

# ![CornerStone][cornerstone] CornerStone Bible
**Bringing the Bible to developers.**

## A Work in Progress
CornerStone has not come out with its first official release yet, but you can read more about it below!

## Free JavaScript Bible API
CornerStone is a standalone JavaScript library that provides the Bible to developers by combining multiple free online API's.

## Architecture
One of the key features of CornerStone is Adapters. Each Adapter is created for a Bible API and is integrated into CornerStone. CornerStone's single API can be used to access all of the content available from each Bible API adapter. As additional adapters are added, no change is required from your code.

### Multi Platform Support
CornerStone is provided via JavaScript, which means that it works across **all platforms**. CornerStone can be used in **Node** projects, **Web apps**, and the browser!
